Setting up Enviroment
========================
Step 1: Install Babel CLI Globally
npm install babel-cli -g

OR 
Install Babel CLI Locally
npm install babel-cli

Step 2:Install below package to convert ES6(ES-2015) code to ES5
 npm install babel-preset-es2015

 Step 3: Create new file with extension .babelrc with below configuration

 {
    "presets": [
        "es2015"
     ]
}

Step 4: Transpile(convert) ES6 file(app.js) to ES5 code file(transpileApp.js)
 babel app.js --out-file transpiledApp.js

Step 5:Automatic transpiling using watch command (this will Automatically transpile our ES6 file to ES5 file)
app.js --watch  --out-file transpiledApp.js

Note:The above manual setup is okay for small project but we should use a build tool for enterspise level applications , below we are using Webpack as a build tool for doing above task .

Using Webpack To Automate above manual task
==============================================

Step 1: npm init 
Create package.json file for the project 

Step 2: npm install webpack --save-dev 
To install Webpack as a dev dependency

Step 3: npm install webpack-cli -g
To install Webpack-cli as a global dependency

Step 4: npm install babel-loader --save-dev
To install babel as a dev dependency

 Step 5: npm install babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev
 To install babel-preset-es2015 as a dev dependency

 Step 6:Create webpack.config.js with below configuration
 module.export={
    entry:'./index.js',
    output:{
        filename:'bundle.js'
    },
    module:{
        loaders:[
            {
                test:/.\js?/,
                loader:'babel-loader',
                exclude:/node_modules/
            }
        ]
    }
}

Step 7: Create src folder and place your source js file(index.js) indside it
we can write our ES6 syntax inside it , which will later be tranpiled to ES5 syntax 

Note : We need to create src folder and insde it index.js as with webpack 4 its how the configuration is read by default

Step 8: Run command => webpack
the above command will create a new folder by the name dist in root directory and  inside it main.js
which will contains webpack configuration code alond with Transpiled ES5 syntax(minified) , this is the only file needed to be included on our index.html page
